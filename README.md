# ocr-challenge :unlock:
This :octocat: repository serves the purpose of showcasing some proeminent OCR technologies in Python, namely:

> * Easy OCR
> * Tesseract (PyTesseract)
> * Keras OCR

Part I of this notebook series simply serves the purpose of getting to know some basic functionality of each OCR library, their methods and functions, the types of outputs they give and highlights some ways to visualize them. :sun_with_face:

Part II (and III?), which is currently under preparation will seek to bring out some more quantitative tools to provide a more unbiased assessement of how each of these technologies under different scenarios, from forms to receipts, to long texts to images with different problems. :exploding_head:

Stay tuned! :eyes: :tongue:
